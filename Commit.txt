Hey Man
Whatsup
had done some uploading but its slow. No satisfaction.
understandable because its testnet.
After some days again here.
Testnet still slow proof generation slow.
Heard about resubmission.
No harm n trying.
here with some new codes hope it works.
Has not been active since has not been given my role to participate in it.
Simply my team has not got access for now.
Ok recently my team got to do the game.
Alas waited, actually more than 14 hrs no proof generated.
Was a time waste but tested my patients.
